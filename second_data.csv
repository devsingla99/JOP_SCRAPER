About the internship

    Selected intern's day-to-day responsibilities include:

1. Monitoring systems:
NOC engineers monitor the performance and capacity of computer systems using a variety of tools. They look for hardware, software, and environmental alerts or malfunctions. When an issue is identified, NOC engineers work to determine the cause of the problem
2. Troubleshooting problems:
When a problem impacts the IT services, the NOC engineer works to triage or troubleshoot the problem, if possible. NOCs generally have standard operating procedures that the NOC engineer will closely follow. This may include coordinating with third-party vendors, customer contacts, or other IT teams.
3. Tracking all issues:
While responding to incidents, the NOC engineer must carefully track and document all issues and resolutions in detail. This increases the knowledge base of the NOC and is a record of the health of the system. Often, the NOC has a ticketing system that the NOC engineer is responsible for updating.
4. Reporting incidents:
When problems are too large or complex for quick troubleshooting, NOC engineers must escalate the issue to management, other IT resources, or 3rd party vendors for assistance in reaching a resolution. NOC engineers maintain ongoing communication within the team and externally, to keep all stakeholders aware of relevant, known issues and the steps being taken. Skill(s) required

Optical character recognition (OCR) is the process of converting the document images into an editable electronic format. This has many advantages like data compression, enabling search or edit options in the images/text, and creating the database for other applications like machine translation, speech recognition, and enhancing dictionaries and language models. OCR in Indian languages is quite challenging due to richness in inflections. Using open-source and commercial OCR systems, we have observed the word error rates (WER) of around 20-50% on printed documents in four different Indic languages. Moreover, developing a highly accurate OCR system with accuracy as high as 90% is not useful unless aided by the mechanism to identify errors. So, we started with the problem of developing ""OpenOCRCorrect"", an end-to-end framework for error detection and corrections in Indic-OCR. Our models outperform state-of-the-art results in 'Error Detection in Indic-OCR' for six Indic languages with varied inflections and we have solved the out of vocabulary problem for Error Correction in Indic-OCR in our ICDAR-2017 conference paper. We further improve the results with the help of sub-word embeddings in our ICDAR-2019 conference paper. The demo video for our framework is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9bqUDrGugc. To install the software, you can go to https://github.com/rohitsaluja22/OpenOCRCorrect and follow the instructions given in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hcdlF-zn8E. There is an immediate demand to keep the softcopy of the Indian preserved texts. Currently, we are targeting Sanskrit. Although the OCR tools available online do a decent job on English texts, they are not optimized for Indic languages. Thus developing an OCR model for the same is our concern. The model should be able to detect text with maximum level accuracy and should be able to draw bounding boxes on each line of the text. Further, in the digitization process of such texts, the second step would be spelling correction and formatting of the text detected by the OCR models. 
'ICDAR 2019 Post-OCR competition': Our team ""CLAM"" secured 2nd position in the multilingual PostOCR competition at ICDAR'19. Our model achieved the highest corrections of 44% in Finnish, which is significantly higher than the overall topper (8% in Finnish). Ou final report for the same - (https://drive.google.com/file/d/15mxNO-M9PiXBnffi7MOa8wUw33nj1xBp/view?usp=drive_open) and poster available (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uuBWu1LQ1QZ49SCgLBoB1er4HpWSzmcx/view).

The demo video for our framework is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9bqUDrGugc. 
To install the software, you can go to https://github.com/rohitsaluja22/OpenOCRCorrect and follow the instructions given in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hcdlF-zn8E. There is an immediate demand to keep the softcopy of the Indian preserved texts. Currently, we are targeting Sanskrit. Although the OCR tools available online do a decent job on English texts, they are not optimized for Indic languages. Thus, we developed an in-house OCR model for the same. The model can detect text with maximum level accuracy and can draw bounding boxes on each line of the text. Further, in the digitization process of such texts, the second step would be spelling correction and formatting of the text detected by the OCR models.

'ICDAR 2019 Post-OCR competition': Our team ""CLAM"" secured 2nd position in the multilingual PostOCR competition at ICDAR'19. Our model achieved the highest corrections of 44% in Finnish, which is significantly higher than the overall topper (8% in Finnish). 
Our final report for the same - (https://drive.google.com/file/d/15mxNOM9PiXBnffi7MOa8wUw33nj1xBp/view?usp=drive_open) and poster available (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uuBWu1LQ1QZ49SCgLBoB1er4HpWSzmcx/view).
